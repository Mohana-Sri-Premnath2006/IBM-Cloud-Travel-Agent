 ## ☁️IBM Cloud Services Used

Below are the IBM Cloud services and tools integrated into this project:

 **IBM Cloud Services**

Unified platform for deploying AI and cloud-native applications.

 **Watsonx.ai Studio**

An integrated environment to build, train, and deploy AI models efficiently.

 **IBM Granite Foundation Models**

Powerful, enterprise-ready foundation models for AI and NLP tasks.

 **Watsonx Vector Index**

Enables efficient similarity search and retrieval in large-scale vector datasets.

 **IBM Cloud Lite Account**

Free-tier account used to access and test IBM Cloud services.

 **IBM Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

Secures cloud resources by managing access, authentication, and roles.

 **IBM Cloud Object Storage**

Highly scalable storage solution for storing model files, datasets, and application assets.



## How It Works

 User asks a travel-related question (e.g., "Book a trip to Goa for 3 days").

 Watsonx.ai with IBM Granite model understands the request using AI.

 Watsonx Vector Index searches for matching destinations, tickets, or plans.

 Backend logic processes bookings, slot reservations, and generates itineraries.

 IBM Cloud Object Storage stores user data, itineraries, and assets.

 IBM Cloud IAM secures access to all services.

## Do's

Ask clear and specific travel questions

➤ Example: “Book a flight from Mumbai to Delhi on 5th August.”

Mention details like location, date, and number of days

➤ Helps the system plan accurately.

Use polite and natural language

➤ The AI is trained on natural interactions — talk to it like a real assistant.

Review the generated itinerary or bookings before confirming

➤ Always double-check to ensure your preferences are met.


Use common travel-related terms

➤ Like “book,” “plan,” “trip,” “flight,” “hotel,” etc.

## Dont's

1. Don’t type vague or incomplete commands
   
 “I want to go somewhere” (Too generic)

2. Don’t mix multiple tasks in one query
   
 “Book my flight and suggest five cities and find a hotel and check weather”

3. Don’t use slang or overly casual language
   
 “Yo, hook me up with a cool vacay plan” (AI might not interpret correctly)

4. Don’t ignore confirmation prompts or final output
   
 “Booking blindly without review can lead to wrong plans”

5. Don’t try to trick the AI with unrealistic scenarios
   
  “Book a 1-day trip to five countries”
